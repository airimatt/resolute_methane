what is called in app.py
what is used in app.py
how helper functions are defined and where they are called

<Libraries>
flask to host the web application
matplotlib to create the plots
numpy to create and use numpy arrays (helpful for slicing and applying operations)

<Files>

<templates/index.html>
Implements the layout of the webpage. Contains css code for style and html code
to add interactive elements such as buttons and text boxes.

<app.py>
Contains main function that:
- Initiates a Flask application where the plots will be hosted.
- Takes in input values from the user for the greenhouse gases.
- Creates the emissions vectors for the three greenhouse gases.
- Calls functions to plot the graphs and renders the plots.

<co2e.py>
Defines function that calculates the CO2 equivalent plot based on the co2e
metric value selected.

<get_agwp_agtp_plots.py>
Contains helper functions that creates the co2, ch4, and no2 plots for both
AGWP and AGTP values. Each function returns the plots for the 3 greenhouse gases.

<import_data.py>
Defines function to take values from .txt files and put them into a
numpy array.

<intervention_emissions.py>
Defines function to create plot for Intervention Emissions graph.

<plot_agtp.py>
Defines function to create plot for Intervention Temp Response graph.
Takes in the plots created in app.py and returns the url of the plotted graph.

<plot_agwp.py>
Defines function to create plot for Intervention AGWP graph.
Takes in the plots created in app.py and returns the url of the plotted graph.

<scenario_intervention.py>
Defines function to create plot for the Scenario with Intervention graph.
The function does the following:
- Determines which SSP scenario to plot
- Gets historical data points to add to plot
- Create and plot the intervention line as well as the co2e line (if a
  metric is selected).

<test.py>
File used for incremental testing of any python code (allows for easier
testing to see outputs directly in terminal)
Temporary file for development - not meant to be kept in folder

<ghc_metrics folder>
Contains AGWP and AGTP values for CO2, N2O, and CH4

<ssp_data folder>
Contains ssp values for the scenario intervention graph, as well as historical data points
